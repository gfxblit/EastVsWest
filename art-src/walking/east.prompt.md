Based on the reference picture, generate a 1-row spritesheet containing exactly 5 frames of a walking animation toward the East (right). The sequence must show a logical walking cycle: initial step, passing position, and contact. Ensure the character’s legs and arms move in opposition to maintain realism. Maintain the exact pixel scale, color palette, and head/body proportions from the reference image. Keep the background solid magenta (#FF00FF).
