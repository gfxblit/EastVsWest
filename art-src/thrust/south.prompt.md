Based on the reference picture, generate a 1-row spritesheet containing exactly 5 frames of animation extending this character’s actions. The row must show the character throwing an invisible spear toward the South (facing the camera), organized as a logical sequence: anticipation, drawback, the throw, and follow-through. Maintain the exact pixel scale, color palette, and head/body proportions from the reference image. Keep the background solid white.
