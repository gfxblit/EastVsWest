Generate a 1-row horizontal spritesheet containing 5 identical-sized square frames on a solid white background. Based on the reference, show the character throwing an invisible spear toward the North (facing up/away from the viewer) in all frames.

Sequence: 1. Anticipation, 2. Drawback, 3. Release, 4. Extension, 5. Follow-through.

Constraints:

Keep the character perfectly centered in every frame.

Ensure the character faces North (up) consistently throughout the sequence.

Maintain the exact pixel art style, colors, and proportions of the reference.

Use only solid white for the background; no black borders or empty frames.
