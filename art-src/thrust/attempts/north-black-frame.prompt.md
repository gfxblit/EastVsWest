Based on the reference picture, generate a 1-row spritesheet containing exactly 5 frames of animation extending this character’s actions. Organize the animation into a strict horizontal grid of five equal-sized square frames (1x5 layout). Each frame must be a perfect square with the character centered precisely in the middle of each cell. > The row must show the character throwing an invisible spear toward the North (up), organized as a logical sequence: anticipation, drawback, the throw, and follow-through. Maintain the exact pixel scale, color palette, and head/body proportions from the reference image. Keep the background solid white and ensure no body parts bleed over the edges of the square frame boundaries.
