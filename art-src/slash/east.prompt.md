Based on the reference picture, generate a 1-row spritesheet containing exactly 5 frames of animation extending this character’s actions. The row must show the character slashing an **invisible** sword toward the East (right), organized as a logical sequence: raising the arm, extending the arm, and a low follow-through recovery. Maintain the exact pixel scale, color palette, and head/body proportions from the reference image. Keep the background solid white.
