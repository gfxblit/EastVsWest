# Sprite Generation Notes

The sprite generated on Fri Jan  2 19:58:54 PST 2026 was found to be **angled** (low top-down/isometric-like) despite the request for a strict **top-down** view.

**Requirement:**
- The sprite MUST be strictly TOP-DOWN (head and shoulders visible, not side profile).
- Future generations must enforce this perspective rigorously.
